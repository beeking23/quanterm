QuARTS, the Quantum Amateur Radio & Technology Society, is an exciting
new technology group that is based in Ormskirk, Lancashire. It was formed
on the 26th October 2016 by a group of like-minded amateur technologists,
makers and crafters who wanted a place to practice their hobby, share
their interests with their peers, enthuse and encourage others with an
interest in technology and promote technology as a hobby to others.
