# QuanTerm
The simple information terminal for the Raspberry Pi B.

Conceived and designed by the Quantum Technology Club ( https://quantumtech.club/ )

The goal is to use the Framebuffer and simple page layout features so that this program will run on the old Raspberry Pi hardware, giving them a useful purpose in life again, and saving them from the back of the CRAP ( https://quantumtech.club/meetings/quantum-crap-sale ) drawer.
